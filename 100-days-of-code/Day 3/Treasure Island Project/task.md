Your goal today is to build a "Chose your own adventure game".
Using what you have learnt in the lessons today you will be building a very simple version of this type of text game. 

Use the flow chart [linked here](https://www.draw.io/?lightbox=1&highlight=0000ff&edit=_blank&layers=1&nav=1&title=Treasure%20Island%20Conditional.drawio#Uhttps%3A%2F%2Fdrive.google.com%2Fuc%3Fid%3D1oDe4ehjWZipYRsVfeAx2HyB7LCQ8_Fvi%26export%3Ddownload) to create the game logic. 

Once you've completed the project, you can always extend the game and make it more interesting!

<div class="hint">
  You can use the lower() function to turn any string into all lower case.

Alternatively you can also use the logical operator "or" to check for other spellings of user choice. e.g. Right, right or RIGHT.
</div>
